# Dapsys Script Generator for NI-DAQ Stimulation
This script will generate scripts for stimulation utilizing a Digitimer stimulator and an NI-DAQ box as controlled through Dapsys.
If you'd like to batch produce scripts, simply modify the presets in the first method of the script, "presets()". The program will then ask
whether or not you'd like to use these presets.
